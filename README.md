# FaceRecognitionRobot
This is a school project of the 3rd Night Technical Highschool of Nea Philadelphia, Athens, Greece. 

We will create an autonomous vehicle - robot which is going to recognise people's faces. 
If it doesn't recognise them, it will ask them for their name. 
It will then say: "Nice to meet you and the name".
Next time it meets that person it will say "Hello name".

It will be able to answer questions about
<ul>
  <li>the weather anywhere in Greece,</li>
  <li>the date and time,</li>
  <li>famous people and theories that exist in wikipedia.</li>
  <li>It will play music from youtube.</li>
  <li>Answer questions about streets and roads and monuments in Athens and show locations via google maps</li>
</ul>
