# FaceRecognitionRobot
This is a school project of the 3rd Night Technical Highschool of Nea Philadelphia, Athens, Greece. 

We will create an autonomous vehicle - robot which is going to recognise people's faces. 
If it doesn't recognise them, it will ask them their name. 
It will then say: "Nice to meet you <name>".
Next time it meets that person it will say "Hello <name>".
